# My DSA-Journey
This is my learning journey with **The Incubator Hub** through the **DSA Project** to becoming a **Data Analyst**

My name is **Ngbede Frank Ajo**, and I had the privilege of being a part of 
**The Incubator Hub (DSA Program) Data Analysis**

This journey was not just educational but deeply transformative. 
What fascinated me the most was the hands-on approach, the mentorship, the community
I’m very grateful to the entire **Incubator Team** and my wonderful, impactful and friendly Facilitators
**(Mr. Temidayo DeeTee, Mr. Femi Ayodele and Mr. Muhsin Hameed)** who made this experience so enriching and unforgettable.

My special thank goes to **My Father in The Lord, Daddy G.O** who made this program possible for me to enjoy free of charge. 
May Almighty continue to bless protect you. We love you…
